            Tamaar Padaar is a new Malayalam Role play server which incorporates classic role playing techniques with new scripts<br>
            and scope for creative role playing. This server is run by a bunch of players who have played in various Malayalam RP<br>
            servers and have left them due to various issues including power gaming and harassment. Since most of us know what<br>
            it’s like to be on the receiving end of this, we make sure that none of this would hamper your role playing experience.<br>
            We aim to give  primary importance to roleplay but that doesn’t mean we’re conservative about the scripts we add. We <br>
            guarantee you an immersive and gratifying experience.<br>
